        The man is made even uglier by the rocking fist you give him. He falls
        to the floor like a bag of cement. Little did you know that this man was
        a well loved regular, and the crowd begin to ascend on you.<br />
        <br />
        Luckily, you see a man outside with 2 horses ushering you out!<br />
        <br />
        In the corner of your eye you see a vacant horse and cart through the
        backdoor.<br />
        <br />
        What's it gonna be amigo?<br
