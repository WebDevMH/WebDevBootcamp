    <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
    <p>
      Passionate traveler and and learner of Japanese language and culture. I
      have enjoyed travelling and exploring Japan's island of Kyushu where I
      developed my photography skill including that of Drone Photography
      capturing active volcanoes, waterfalls and wild horses. With music being
      another passion, I have enjoyed playing guitar and piano over many years
      and have developed an excellent musical ear for instant, highly accurate
      improvisation. Lately, I have enjoyed learning 3D animation using Autodesk
      software, including 3dsmax and MotionBuilder utilising motion capture and
      game-engines to create a highly favorable short animated film.
