            <p>The first task in our Bootcamp journey!</p>
            <hr/>
        <h2>Occupation - Unemployed...it sucks.</h2>
                <p>
                    I studied Film at university where I specialised in cinematography and editing.<br>
                    After graduating, I moved to Southwest Japan where I taught English for two years.<br>
                    <br>
                    Over the last 2 years, I have developed an interest “Machinima”, a term used to describe making cinematic<br>
                    videos within game engines. It is through this interest where I have developed an interest in<br>
                    coding. This is due to having to use certain codes and scripts to make the game engine behave in certain<br>
                    ways. An example of this would be making a helicopter land in a certain position or exploding at a certain time.<br>
                    <br>
                    Creating films or cinematic cutscenes in this way is incredibly time-consuming and moving forward,<br>
                    I would like to work and improve on coding skills that will hopefully lead to self-improvement and employment.<br>
